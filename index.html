        <p>
          We are the first generation to know we’re destroying the world, and we
          could be the last that can do anything about it. Speaking up is one of
          the most powerful things you can do especially if it’s to the right
          people. Talk to your MP. Tell them to commit to action to protect our
          natural world.

          One of the most efficient ways of lowering your environmental impact
          is by travelling responsibly. This means, whenever you can, choosing a
          more sustainable way to get from A to B - walk or cycle when you can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving away from a meat-dominated diet towards a more plant-based diet
          can lower your impact on the environment. Vegetarian and vegan foods
          are massively on the rise and becoming far more common in restaurants,
          cafes and supermarkets, so you’ll rarely struggle. [wwf.org.uk]

        <h2>SAVE WATER</h2>
        <img id="water" src="img/water.png" alt="water" />
        <p>
          Next to air, water is the most important element for the preservation
          of life. Water is a finite commodity which, if not managed properly,
          will result in shortages in the near future. Water conservation can go
          a long way to help alleviate these impending shortages. [volusia.org]

        <p>
          A typical shower uses five to ten gallons of water a minute. Limit
          your showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash down and rise off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saving water is important to help protecting our earth. It is not
          helpful to start from 1 to 100, but small steps make the journey to a
          eco-friendly life easier as expected.
